# Python-Reactor-Sims
A super nuanced nuclear reactor simulator which is very unrealistic and is very much still a work in progress.


There are 2 variations that are currently available:
- SCR mode or Single Control Rod mode
- MCR 5x5 mode or Multiple Control Rod mode with a 5 x 5 core and 4 control rods

I am also working on adding MCR 7x7 mode
