# Python-Reactor-Sims
A super nuanced nuclear reactor simulator that is very unrealistic and is very much still a work in progress.


There are 2 variations that are currently available:
- SCR mode or Single Control Rod mode
- MCR 5x5 mode or Multiple Control Rod mode with a 5 x 5 core and 4 control rods

I am also working on adding MCR 7x7 mode


## PyPWR_SCR_SL.py
The PyPWR_SCR_SL.py file is the original and base file. It has a basic command line interface and both the SCR mode and the MCR 5x5 mode

## MDV_SCR_MCR.py
The MDV_SCR_MCR.py file is my attempt to compress the 2 modes it does not work yet and is very buggy

## PyPWR_MCR.py
The PyPWR_MCR.py file is my attempt to upgrade the original PyPWR file into a GUI interface

### So Far:
-  Title/start page

### Still to Go
- quite literally everything to do with actual mechanics
  - home display screen
    - Reactivity (âˆ†K/K)
    - Control rod insertion
    - Temp
    - Reactor water fill level
    - Reactor pressure
  - Switchboard
    - Feed water Pumps 1/2 
    - 
  - electronic breaker board
  - control rod selection board
