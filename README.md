# Python-Reactor-Sims
A super nuanced nuclear reactor simulator which is very unrealistic and is very much still a work in progress.


There are 2 variations that are currently available:
- SCR mode or Single Control Rod mode
- MCR 5x5 mode or Multiple Control Rod mode with a 5 x 5 core and 4 control rods

I am also working on adding MCR 7x7 mode


##PyPWR_SCR_SL.py
The PyPWR_SCR_SL.py file is the original and base file. It has a basic command line interface and both the SCR mode and the MCR 5x5 mode

##MDV_SCR_MCR.py
The MDV_SCR_MCR.py file is my attempt to compress the 2 modes it does not work yet and is very buggy

##PyPWR_MCR.py
The PyPWR_MCR.py file is my attempt to upgrade the original PyPWR file into a GUI interface

So far:
